# MySQL_db_conn_with_Java

This is a personal project to practice my skills with both Java and SQL. In this project I used the Mysql's native database "World" to print the name os the first 10 countries in the table Country and their respective oficcial language.

I look to further improve this code and implement new features such as a search option where the user can search for a country and get all the data from that country.
